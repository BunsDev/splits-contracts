# Network Configuration

This folder contains the configuration for given networks 
(e.g. rinkeby.json is the configuration for the Rinkeby test-net). 
These configuration files are meant to be used to configure external applications (like dApps) 
and thus contain a base set of information that may be useful. 
These configuration files are auto-generated when doing local development.
