# Splits (deprecated)

Allows deployment of a minimal proxy contract that specifies a Merkle root describing an allocation across a number of different addreses. Once ETH has been deposited, `incrementWindow` can be called, and members of the split can claim their allocation.

Please send feedback to g@mirror.xyz

* 10 ETH for any critical bugs that could result in loss of funds.
